# [217. Contains Duplicates](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)

Given an integer array <code>nums</code>, return <code>true</code> if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return <code>false</code> if every element is distinct.

# Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        found = set()
        for num in nums:
            if num in found:
                return True
            else:
                found.add(num)
        return False
```

# Explanation

The idea is to linearly go through the input "nums" and basically remember everything we've seen in a constant-access data structure.

By doing so, we're able to check, efficiently, if we've encountered a particular entry in nums before.

Alternatively, if linear space was an issue and you could afford to sacrifice some time complexity:
Sorting the nums list and comparing adjacent values would also work. This would simply be **O(nlgn)** time and **O(1)** space.

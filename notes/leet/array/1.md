# [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Given an array of integers <code>nums</code> and an integer <code>target</code>, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to <code>target</code>.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

# Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        found = {}
        for idx, val in enumerate(nums):
            if target-val in found:
                return (idx, found[target-val])
            else:
                found[val] = idx
```

# Explanation

x + y = z

The key to this problem is realizing that if the target is **z** and we're currently checking if **y** is a piece of our answer, then **x** would have to be z-y. Now that we know what we're looking for we can simply check if we've previously seen it (this can be made efficient with the use of a dictionary).

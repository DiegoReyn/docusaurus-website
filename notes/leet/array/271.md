# [271. Encode and Decode Strings](https://www.lintcode.com/problem/659/)

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement encode and decode

**Note:**

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.


# Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def encode(self, strs):
        res = ""
        for s in strs:
            res += str(len(s)) + "#" + s
        return res

    def decode(self, s):
        res, i = [], 0

        while i < len(s):
            j = i
            while s[j] != "#":
                j += 1
            length = int(s[i:j])
            res.append(s[j + 1 : j + 1 + length])
            i = j + 1 + length
        return res
```
Time Complexity: **O(n)**

Space Complexity: **O(n)**
# Explanation

The key idea is to prepend each word with its length and a termination character so that decode is able to process any input.

String concatenation can be made more efficient by emulating java's string builder. i.e. making it a empty list and basically append all the strings. Then simply use <code>"".join(res)</code>, or whatever you name the list.

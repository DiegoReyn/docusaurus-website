# [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/)

Given an integer array <code>nums</code>, return an array <code>answer</code> such that <code>answer[i]</code> is equal to the product of all the elements of <code>nums</code> except <code>nums[i]</code>.

The product of any prefix or suffix of <code>nums</code> is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in <code>O(n)</code> time and without using the division operation.

# Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        ret = [1] * len(nums)
        currprod = 1
        for idx in range(len(nums)):
            ret[idx] *= currprod #no need for "*="
            currprod *= nums[idx]
        currprod = 1
        for idx in range(len(nums)-1, -1, -1):
            ret[idx] *= currprod
            currprod *= nums[idx]
        return ret
```
Time Complexity: **O(n)**

Space Complexity: **O(n)**
# Explanation

If one pass is done where the curr prod is recorded in an additional array (lprod), and a second pass is done backwards (rprod). Then answer[i] value would simply be lprod[i] * rpord[i]. However, with a little thought, the neccessity for two seperate arrays evaporates. The answer array itself can be used.

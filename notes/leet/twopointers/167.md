# [167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

Given a **1-indexed** array of integers <code>numbers</code> that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific <code>target</code> number. Let these two numbers be <code>numbers[index1]</code> and <code>numbers[index2]</code> where <code>1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length</code>.

Return the indices of the two numbers, <code>index1</code> and <code>index2</code>, **added by one** as an integer array <code>[index1, index2]</code> of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is **exactly one solution**. You may **not** use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

# Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        l, r = 0, len(numbers)-1
        while l < r:
            curr_sum = numbers[l] + numbers[r]
            if curr_sum == target:
                return [l+1, r+1]
            elif curr_sum < target:
                l+=1
            else:
                r-=1
```
Time Complexity: **O(n)**

Space Complexity: **O(1)**
# Explanation

The idea is to begin by looking at both ends of the input array. From here, if

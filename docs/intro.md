# Projects Intro

Here you can find documentation for some of my projects. 
Source code for most projects is usually linked to on the project page itself.

If there is no source code linked, I most likely am not able to disclose it due to NDA's or other privacy agreements.
However, a showcase is provided with an outline of my specific contributions.
